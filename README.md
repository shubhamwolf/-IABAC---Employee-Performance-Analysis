# IABAC---Employee-Performance-Analysis

Project Title: Employee Performance Analysis

Project Overview:

 The Employee Performance Analysis project endeavors to develop a robust predictive model for
 categorizing employees into distinct performance tiers, namely "High Performers" "Average Performers" and "Low
 Performers." Leveraging advanced data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to
 enhance human resource management and decision-making processes within organizations.
Project Objectives:

Performance Classification:

Implement a suite of machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier,
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier, Gradient Boosting, and
XGBoost, along with hyperparameter tuning, to accurately classify employees based on their historical performance data.
Data Collection:

Gather comprehensive data on employees, encompassing attributes like years of experience, educational background,
department, manager ratings, and other pertinent job-related features. Additionally, historical performance reviews
and feedback are considered.
Data Preprocessing:

Conduct thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and data quality concerns.
Transform categorical variables and standardize or normalize numerical features as needed.
Feature Engineering:

Identify and engineer features that significantly impact employee performance. This includes
creating composite features, performing feature scaling, and employing feature selection techniques.
Model Building:

Utilize Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier, Decision Trees,
Random Forests,   Bagging Classifiers, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models, optimizing their hyperparameters
to predict employee performance based on the available data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Fine-tune the
models to maximize predictive accuracy and ensure reliable results.
Interpretability:

Ensure that the models provide interpretable insights into the factors influencing employee performance classification.
This empowers HR professionals and managers to make informed decisions.
Feature Selection:

Leverage the powerful XGBoost algorithm for feature selection. Identify the top 20 features that have the most
significant impact on employee performance classification.
Deployment:

Implement the final model in a real-world HR environment, integrating it seamlessly into the HR management system.
This assists in streamlining performance assessment and decision-making.
Conclusion:

The Employee Performance Prediction Classification project represents a pivotal stride in leveraging data science and
machine learning to drive effective talent management. By employing a diverse set of algorithms and feature selection
methodologies, this project empowers organizations to make informed decisions about their workforce, ultimately
contributing to the overall success of the business.
